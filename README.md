FSCNMF
============================================
<p align="justify">
An implementation of "Fusing Structure and Content via Non-negative Matrix Factorization for Embedding Information Networks". FSCNMF is a graph embedding algorithm which learns an embedding of nodes and fuses the node representations with node attributes. The procedure places nodes in an abstract feature space where information about a fixed order procimity is preserved and attributes of neighbours within the proximity are also part of the representation. FSCNMF learns the joint feature-proximal representations using regularized non-negative matrix factorization. In our implementation we assumed that the proximity matrix used in the approximation is sparse, hence the solution runtime can be linear in the number of nodes for low proximity. For a large proximity order value (which is larger than the graph diameter) the runtime is quadratic. We did not make any assumptions about the sparsity of the feature matrix.</p>

### Requirements

The codebase is implemented in Python 2.7. package versions used for development are just below.
```
networkx          1.11
tqdm              4.19.5
numpy             1.13.3
pandas            0.20.3
texttable         1.2.1
scipy             1.1.0
argparse          1.1.0
```

### Datasets

The code takes an input graph in a csv file. Every row indicates an edge between two nodes separated by a comma. The first row is a header. Nodes should be indexed starting with 0. A sample graph for the `Wikipedia Giraffes` is included in the  `input/` directory.

### Options

Learning of the embedding is handled by the `src/main.py` script which provides the following command line arguments.

#### Input and output options

```
  --edge-path STR           Input graph path.           Default is `input/giraffe_edges.csv`.
  --feature-path STR        Input Features path.        Default is `input/giraffe_features.csv`.
  --output-path STR         Embedding path.             Default is `output/giraffe_fscnmf.csv`.
```

#### Model options

```
  --dimensions INT         Number of embeding dimensions.                     Default is 32.
  --order INT              Order of adjacency matrix powers.                  Default is 3.
  --iterations INT         Number of power interations.                       Default is 500.
  --alpha_1 FLOAT          Alignment parameter for adjacency matrix.          Default is 1000.0.
  --alpha_2 FLOAT          Adjacency basis regularization.                    Default is 1.0.
  --alpha_3 FLOAT          Adjacency features regularization.                 Default is 1.0.
  --beta_1  FLOAT          Alignment parameter for feature matrix.            Default is 1000.0.
  --beta_2  FLOAT          Attribute basis regularization .                   Default is 1.0.
  --beta_3  FLOAT          Attribute feature regularization.                  Default is 1.0.
  --gamma FLOAT            Embedding mixing parameter.                        Default is 0.5.  
  --lower-control FLOAT    Overflow control parameter.                        Default is 10**-15.  
```

### Examples

The following commands learn a graph embedding and write the embedding to disk. The node representations are ordered by the ID.

Creating aN FSCNMF embedding of the default dataset with the default hyperparameter settings. Saving the embedding at the default path.

```
python src/main.py
```
Creating an FSCNMF embedding of the default dataset with 128 dimensions and approximation order 1.

```
python src/main.py --dimensions 128 --order 1
```

Creating an FSCNMF embedding of the default dataset with asymmetric mixing.

```
python src/main.py --gamma 0.1
```

Creating an embedding of an other dataset the `Wikipedia Dogs`. Saving the output in a custom folder.

```
python src/main.py --edge-path input/dog_edges.csv --feature-path input/dog_features.csv --output-path output/dog_fscnmf.csv
```
